## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & APIs

This project was built using modern web technologies and Chrome Extension APIs (Manifest V3).

* **Core Technologies**: `HTML5`, `CSS3`, `JavaScript (ES6 Modules)`

* **Chrome Extension APIs (Manifest V3)**:
    * `chrome.contextMenus`: To create the right-click menu options ("Read aloud" and "Add to Dictionary").
    * `chrome.storage.sync`: To securely save user settings and the vocabulary list, syncing them across all user's devices.
    * `chrome.offscreen`: To reliably play audio from a service worker context, a requirement for Manifest V3.
    * `chrome.tabs.sendMessage` & `chrome.runtime.onMessage`: For robust communication between the background script, popup, and content scripts.
    * `content_scripts`: To inject the custom tooltip directly onto the webpage for instant user feedback.

* **External APIs**:
    * **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API**: Leveraged for its high-quality, natural "WaveNet" voices.
    * **MyMemory Translation API**: Used as a free, reliable, and key-less API for on-the-fly word translation.
